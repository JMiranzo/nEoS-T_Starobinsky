# nEoS-T_Starobinsky
Work on numerical methods to compute neutron stars in Starobinsky's Cosmology, using tab. EoS with a phase transition.

Master's student in UCM (Universidad Complutense de Madrid). I have worked with RNS previously so my next step will be trying to edit the code to run it with modified gravity equations, specifically the ones in Starobinsky's f(R) Cosmology.

Also, in this project I will use a wide range of tabulated EoS which present a phase transition (from nEoS-T team: https://teorica.fis.ucm.es/nEoS/nEoST.html).

Eventually, the aim of the projecy will be to constraint Starobinsky's constant 'a' ( f(R) = R + a R^2 ) using astrophysical data.
